Description:
    This sub-generator is to be used by Simlife modules, so they can access the
    main Simlife configuration and variables.

Example:
    This sub-generator is not meant to be used directly.

You can compose this sub-generator from a Simlife module, which is itself a generator,
using:

const configuration = {'moduleName': 'my-own-generator'};

templates: function() {
    this.composeWith(require.resolve('simlife:modules'), {
        configuration: configuration
    });
}
